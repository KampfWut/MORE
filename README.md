# MORE
 This is an Implementation of the MORE algorithm as described in our paper:
 
 Xu, J., Yu, S., Sun, K., Ren, J., Lee, I, Pan, S., Xia, F. (2020). 
 Multivariate Relations Aggregation Learning in Social Networks. JCDL 2020.
 
 The paper has been included in JCDL2020
 
 ## Requirements
  - Tensorflow
  - networkx

 ## TheoreticalBasis
  This algorithm uses the network motif to represent the rich multivariate relational structure in the network and incorporates it as a structural feature into the graph learning process.
 
 ## Acknowledgements
 The original version of this code base was originally forked from https://github.com/tkipf/gcn/, and we owe many thanks to Thomas Kipf for making his code available.
