 ## Requirements
  - Tensorflow
  - networkx

 ## Theoretical Basis
  This algorithm uses the network motif to represent the rich multivariate relational structure in the network and incorporates it as a structural feature into the graph learning process. Specifically, by separately extracting the structural features and attribute features of the network data, combined with the aggregation learning process based on GCN or other network representation learning methods, we can obtain a more effective network representation tensor. In the paper, we apply the network representation tensor to the network node classification task through the softmax structure.
